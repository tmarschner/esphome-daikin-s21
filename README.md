# esphome-daikin-s21

ESPHome component to control Daikin indoor mini-split units with s21 ports.

Many thanks to the work by [revk][1] on the fantastic [Faikin][2] project, which
was the primary inspiration and guide for building this ESPHome component. In 
addition, the very active and resourceful community that project has fostered
that has decoded much of the protocol.

A huge thanks to [joshbenner][4], the original author of this integration. His
[repository][5] would be my preferred place to commit patches to avoid
fragmentation, but he lacks the time at the moment to manage the project.

## Features

Climate:
- Setpoint temperature.
- Selectable climate modes OFF, HEAT_COOL, COOL, HEAT, FAN_ONLY and DRY.
- Independent climate action reporting. See what your unit is trying to do, e.g. heating while in HEAT_COOL.
- Fan modes auto, silent and 1-5.
- Swing modes horizontal, vertical, and both.
- Optional humidity reporting.

Sensors:
* Inside temperature (usually measured at indoor air handler return)
* Outside temperature (outside exchanger)
* Coil temperature (indoor air handler's coil)
* Fan speed
* Vertical swing angle (directional flap)
* Compressor frequency (outside exchanger)
* Humidity (not supported on all units, will report a consistent 50% if not present)
* Unit demand from compressor with configurable scaling factor

On multihead systems the outdoor values will be the same (accounting for sampling jitter). It
could be cleaner to only configure these sensors on your "primary" ESPhome device. ESPHome is
adding support for multiple devices, when this is released I will document how to do this.

## Limitations

* This code has only been tested on ESP32 pico and ESP32-S3.
* Tested with 4MXl36TVJU outdoor unit and CTXS07LVJU, FTXS12LVJU, FTXS15LVJU indoor units.
* Does not detect nor support powerful or econo modes.
* Does not support comfort or presence detection features on some models.
* Does not interact with the indoor units schedules (do that with HA instead).
* Currently targets Version 0 protocol support due to the equipment available to the author.

## Hardware

### S21 Port

**NOTE:** The Daikin S21 port provides >5V, so if you intend to power your
board on this pin, be sure to test its output and regulate voltage accordingly.

On my Daikin units, the S21 port has the following pins:

* 1 - Unused
* 2 - TX (5V)
* 3 - RX (5V)
* 4 - VCC (>5V!!)
* 5 - GND

The S21 plug is JST `EHR-5` and related header `B5B-EH-A(LF)(SN)`, though the
plug pins are at standard 2.5mm pin header widths.

### PCB

I've been using the board designed by [revk][1] available [here][3]. Note that
revk's design includes a FET that inverts the logic levels on the ESP's RX pin,
which required using two separate UART devices to get around an ESPHome limit
on having pins inverted differently.

Here is an example of how daikin_s21 can be used with one inverted UART pin:

```yaml
uart:
  - id: s21_tx
    tx_pin: 26
    baud_rate: 2400
    data_bits: 8
    parity: EVEN
    stop_bits: 2

  - id: s21_rx
    rx_pin:
      number: 27
      inverted: true
    baud_rate: 2400
    data_bits: 8
    parity: EVEN
    stop_bits: 2

daikin_s21:
  tx_uart: s21_tx
  rx_uart: s21_rx
```
